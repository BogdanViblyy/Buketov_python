The Waterfall model in programming is a traditional software development approach where the process is linear and sequential. It involves a series of clearly defined steps that must be completed one after the other. These steps are typically:

    Requirement Analysis: Understanding what the user needs.

    System Design: Planning the architecture and features of the software.

    Implementation: Writing the code based on the design.

    Testing: Checking if the software works as intended.

    Deployment: Releasing the software to users.

    Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software after it's been deployed.

The key characteristic of the Waterfall model is that each phase must be finished before moving on to the next one. This makes it easy to manage, but it can be less flexible if changes are needed during the process.
